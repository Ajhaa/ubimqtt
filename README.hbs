# ubimqtt

Mqtt conveniecy library for using the Ubikampus Mqtt bus. Supports publishing
signed content on Mqtt, subscribing to content signed by a given keypair, and
subscribing to content signed by a known publisher whose public key can be found
on the Mqtt bus itself.

The signature format is JWS JSON, but the payload is unisually publised on Mqtt in the format output by
JSON.stringify() without Base64 encoding to keep string payloads human-readable on-the-wire.

See the unit tests in spec/ for usage examples.
